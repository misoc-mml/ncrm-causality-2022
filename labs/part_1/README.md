# Labs part 1 - Machine Learning

We will put into practice all the stuff discussed in the first lecture. We start with a closer look at the two classic machine learning tasks: regression and classification. We will approach each of the two by first going through an example dataset together, step by step, followed by an exercise involving another dataset where everyone can try to perform a similar analysis but on their own, with our assistance as needed. All incorporated datasets are available under [data](data) directory.

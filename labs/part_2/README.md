# Labs part 2 - Causal Inference

In this part, we will combine our knowledge of regression and classification methods to estimate effects of interventions. Similarly to the previous part, we start with a guided example. Further exercises provide an opportunity to work more independently and put into practice everything we have learnt so far. All incorporated datasets are available under [data](data) folder.
